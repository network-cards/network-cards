# Network Cards

A network card is a three-panel tabular summary of a network dataset:

<p align='center'>
<img src='network-card-example.png' alt='Example network card for the Zachary Karate Club' width='600'>
</p>

The first panel provides an overall summary of the network, the second summarizes the structure of the network (size, density, connectivity), and the third panel provides additional meta-information, what metadata are associated with nodes and links, how were the data gathered, and so forth.

Network cards are intended to be _concise, readable and flexible_, allowing researchers across fields to quickly read and understand studies involving network datasets.

## Example

`Network Cards` provides [fill-in templates](templates/) but you can also generate and save a card programmatically. 
Here's Python code where we load a network from a file and compute the basic card: 

```python
import networkx as nx
import network_cards as nc

G = nx.read_edgelist("karate_club.edgelist")

card = nc.NetworkCard(G)
print(card)
```
This gives:

```text
                   Name                       
                   Kind Undirected, unweighted
              Nodes are                       
              Links are                       
         Considerations                       
        Number of nodes                     34
        Number of links                     78
               Degree^1        4.58824 [1, 17]
             Clustering                  0.571
              Connected                    Yes
               Diameter                      5
 Assortativity (degree)                 -0.476
          Node metadata                       
          Link metadata                       
       Date of creation                       
Data generating process                       
                 Ethics                       
                Funding                       
               Citation                       

^1: Distributions summarized with average [min, max].
```

Unfortunately, none of the important definitions, details or meta-information are computable, so
most of the fields outside the structure panel are blank.
Let's use `network_cards` methods to populate the remaining fields ourselves:

```python
card.update_overall("Name", "Zachary Karate Club")
card.update_overall("Nodes are", "Members of club at US university")
card.update_overall("Links are", "Members consistently interacted outside club")
card.update_overall("Considerations", "Heavily used as an example network")

card.update_metainfo({
    "Node metadata":           "None",
    "Link metadata":           "None (original study included eight interaction contexts)",
    "Date of creation":        "1977",
    "Data generating process": "Direct observation of club members during period 1970-72",
    "Funding":                 "None",
    "Citation":                "Zachary (1977)"
    })
```

We use `card.update_overall` and `card.update_metainfo` to insert entries into the previous card. These can be used one at a time (like we did when updating the overall panel) or a dictionary can be passed to update multiple entries at once.

Now, print the revised card with `print(card)`:

```text

              Links are              Members consistently interacted outside club
         Considerations                        Heavily used as an example network
        Number of nodes                                                        34
